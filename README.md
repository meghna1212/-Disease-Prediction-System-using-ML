# 2. Description
Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company, which has recently expanded to other global locations, and has completely disrupted the food delivery industry.

It is one of the most comprehensive and user-friendly apps where people can search for nearby restaurants and caf√©s, order food online, and get it delivered at their doorstep in no time. Moreover, you can also get accurate information about restaurants as it provides menus, reviews, and ratings.

Through this dashboard, I have tried to provide information about Zomato at-a-glance. I have tried to visually represent the performance of the company, using graphs and charts and show how they are distributed across the globe.
